                                        There are a number of
                                        different positive and
                                        negative Effects that Heroes
                                        can apply to ally and enemy
                                        Heroes, as well as ally and
                                        enemy rows. If a Hero
                                        applies an Effect to a Hero
                                        or row, the Hero's counter
                                        will show up next to the row
                                        or on the Hero card. These
                                        counters can be clicked to
                                        show the card which applied
                                        the Effect, so that you can
                                        easily read the Ability
